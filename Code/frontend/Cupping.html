        <p>An ancient form of alternative medicine using myofascial decompression to release tissue restrictions. It
            mobilizes blood flow, aids in pain relief and soft tissue recovery.</p>
        <p>Silicone cups are placed on the skin, creating a vacuum by suctioning out the air, which may break capillary
            vessels, leading to round marks that may look like bruises. You may feel a tight sensation in the area of
            the cup, however, many people describe the feeling as relaxing and soothing, not painful. These marks fade
            in one to two weeks and do not represent any detriment to your health. The natural healing process will see
            any skin discolouration and/or skin damage created by the suctions cups.</p>
        <p>We encourage you to ask your doctor or therapist if you feel uncomfortable or have further doubts.</p>

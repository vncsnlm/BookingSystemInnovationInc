            <p>RAPID NeuroFascial Reset, is a neurologically based, active, therapeutic technique that addresses
                the central
                nervous systems role in alleviating tension and restrictions within the body. RAPID is an
                evidence based
                manual therapy technique that can be used to quickly and effectively eliminate pain in their
                patients.</p>
            <p>RAPID therapist use a combination of hands on palpation, examination, and treatment. The
                therapist palpates
                the tissues with her hands to evaluate the texture, tightness and movement of muscles, fascia,
                tendons,
                ligaments and nerves. Hypersensitive areas are treated by combining precisely directed depth and
                tension
                with very specific patient movements.</p>
            <p>RAPID sessions may be uncomfortable. This occurs as the neurological system is being stimulated
                to restore
                normal function.</p>

        <p>
            Aida was born and raised in Puebla, Mexico. She obtained her Bachelor’s Degree in International Trade. She
            later completed her Master’s Degree in Educational Management. She worked as a history, geography and ethics
            professor for 15 years before making the move with her family to Canada. Here she was looking for a change
            in her career and was intrigued by Massage Therapy. Aida continues updating her knowledge and techniques to
            be able to provide excellent tailored therapy for each person.
